# Pong Feedback
##### Your task was to create your own version of the classic Pong game. 


# Planning and Documentation
- [x] UML diagram present
- [x] Pseudocode/flowchart for collision detection algorithm 

**Notes:** Your UML shows your two classes which is good, but think about what further objects you have in your game e.g. Paddle and Ball or GameObject. Your flow-chart shows the ball's movement but it would be good to have more detail on the collision detection algorithm e.g. how do you work out if the ball hits walls/paddle? What calculations will you make?
 


# Gameplay 

#### Basic Requirements: At Good Standard
- [x] Working menu screen
- [x] 2 player game
- [x] Moving ball 
- [x] Collision detection working
- [x] Paddle movement
- [x] Scoring system


#### Other Functionality
- [x] Win and lose states
- [x] Replay options
- [ ] Working extensions to the base requirements  

**Notes:** You have created a working Pong game and a basic menu screen. The paddle movement is not smooth so you need to check your key handling code. The collision detection can be a bit glitchy but works ok for the most part. You have added a win condition which is good as well as the option to replay afterwards. It would be good to have the ability to pause/restart mid game too. 


# Implementation
- [ ] Well structured and easy to follow
- [x] Correct use of the coding standard
- [ ] Good use of object orientated design
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Use of delta time

**Notes:** You have attempted to create your own Vector class but then unfortunately not used it from your game. It would have been nice to see some further classes, such as Paddle, Ball or GameObject, to represent objects in your game. You have added a couple of functions but there are still some very long functions in the Game class. This is a good indication that you should create some functions using sensible blocks of code. This would help your codebase structure and make it more readable. You have mostly followed the coding standards but keep an eye on your variable names.   



# Marking

Your grade and the breakdown is shown below. The weightings for each component are shown in brackets.

| Component                                            |  MARKS   |
| -----------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| Problem analysis (UML, pseudo-code/flowchart) (10%)  |  58.00%   |
| Playability and runs as expected (50%)               |  62.00%   |
| Technical implementation (40%)                       |  53.00%   | 
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Total**                                            |**58.00%** |


The three components total 100%. 
This assignment contributes **20%** of your portfolio mark.
